### Roadmap after placement (1200-)
 Most engagements are for 2 years (can sign up with client after this)
 Regular touch points with and account manager
 Pastoral care from someone on the engagement team
 Touch points with clients and spart at 1, 3, 6 months. Then 18 months about transition.


#### Q & A
- Prep for interview with a client based on previous Spartan experience (who is the manager, client, what kinds of questions to expect (scenario based questions - How do you think about the situation?))
- Minimum engagement is 3 months, most are long term
- Project based work will be shorter (3-6 months)
- Average time on the bench is about a week at the moment
- Can transition to become a Senior Spartan if not given the chance to join the company, can continue with Sparta or choose to leave.
- Current projects, e.g. FA (player tracking, data analysis for sports projects), Sky (19 Spartans - Cloud migrations), TelCo (security), Content Platforms (VoD), 
- What are the chances of people getting preferences - Would like to, but everyone has been flexible on both location and industry.
- Most clients are either remote or hybrid (2-3 days), maybe not all 5 days.
- Don't tailor your CV to a particular client.
- Clients can come in on week 3 - 4 with Team Fit questions to get people in.
- Clients in the game industry - None (SumoDigital)
- Count of clients is somewhere 40-50.
- Look for local Spartans first and then look for all Spartans available.
- Majority of clients are London based. It all depends on timing.
- Embedding time may require more time in the office, after that greater flexibility
- Some limited support during the move.
- Public sector, Commercial, Financial services
- Rapid client aquisition
- None in the FAANG group
- Wide variety of projects (e.g. Schroeder's - Data Analysts to Low-Code/No-Code Platforms, HSBC - Getting rid of Data Science in favour Data Analytics) - Common Themes (Expectations: Keen, Enthusastic, Malleable, Adaptable, Flexibly, Just Get Stuck In) - View this as a long term... should be thinking in terms the next five years. Get the perm offer, and get a promotion under your belt - Then you are set in the career and think about moving on.
- Senior Spartan money - There is a significant increase - Build some flexibility in to Salary (Upper spectrum - 6mos with Warner Brothers, then to SMBC, 2.5 years, perm at £63k, Asset management £50k, Insurance £40-45k) Range £37.5k to £60k.
