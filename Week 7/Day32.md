# Day 32 - 09/08/2022 - Web Testing

Where is the logic?
- If it is in the API then test there


Selenium tests are slow, harder to write, harder to maintain and brittle
*"You only get one (Selenium Test)"* - Daniel Webb


Understanding how to write them and understanding the challenges of using them
- Knowing how to articulate strategy on how it could be "better" by referring to the drawbacks


What is the most efficient way to test what I am trying to test?
- Too many testers test things at the UI layer rather than testing the functionality by understanding the internal structure

*"I've seen Selenium packs that take hours to run. Do you want to wait that long to find out if you broken something?"* - DW
- 15 minutes for tests run AND deployment
