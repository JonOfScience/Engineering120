## Defect Management

### Why do Defects happen?

Most Important - Levels of Testing Skill (Devs - unit tests, Testers - )

### What happens?

When we encounter a defect - Collect all information and report

### Defect Lifecycle

[See previous notes on Defect workflow]

If Rejected - Clarify against requirements, get confirmation from the product owner

### Defect Severity

Priority rating (on JIRA)

"The degree of impact that a defect has on the development or operation of a system." - ISTQB Glossary

Severity is about the system - How it severe it is to the system
Priority is about the business

Severity : Critical, High, Medium, Low

Priority : Urgent (P1), High (P2), Medium (P3), Low (P4)


Severity-Priority Matrix

Defect Report - Very important to include the "Date" for a variety of management, tracking and metrics reasons.

Traceability
- We know something is high Priority because we can trace it back to a (high priority) requirement.
- Also useful if a requirement is descoped we can see how that affects the test cases

Traceability Matrix
- Forward traceability matrix
- Backward traceability matrix
- Bidirectional traceability matrix

### JIRA

#### Defect Management Committee (for large defects)
- Cross functional team (everyone, not just tests)

Determines
- Validity of new defects
- Action to take
- Priority and severity

Actions should consider
- Benefits
- Costs
- Risks
